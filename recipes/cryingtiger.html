                <h3>History</h3>
                    <p> <b>Crying Tiger (Suea Rong Hai)</b> is a classic Thai grilled beef dish known for its bold, smoky flavor and 
                        spicy dipping sauce. The name loosely translates to “the crying tiger,” with folklore suggesting the 
                        meat is so good—or so juicy—that even a tiger would cry after losing it. Traditionally made with grilled 
                        beef served alongside a fiery nam jim jaew sauce, the dish reflects Thailand’s balance of heat, acidity, 
                        salt, and sweetness. It is especially popular in northeastern Thailand (Isan), where grilled meats and 
                        chili-forward sauces are staples of everyday cooking.</p>
